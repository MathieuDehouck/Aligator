# Resources 
The code has been designed to use external resources for terms and names and their pronunciation(s): see README.md for details. These resources are not directly integrated into the publicly available code on Github, but apart from it. 

## Morphalou
The AliGator 2.0. code will use the Morphalou lexicon as an external resource for the terms and their pronunciation(s). We've made a few modifications to this resource. The GitHub repository will contain both the original and the modified resource. Both files are licensed under the LGPL for Linguistic Resources (LGPLLR). It will also use the Wiktionary as an external resource for the names and their pronunciation(s). As with Aligator 1.1., we've made a few modifications to this resource. The GitHub repository will contain both the original and the modified resource. Both files are licensed under LGPLLR. The puns produced by Aligator 2.0. are licensed under CC-BY-SA.
