#Code and resources

The code for the application AliGator 1.1. is available on Github at the following address: [https://github.com/MathieuDehouck/Aligator](https://github.com/MathieuDehouck/Aligator). This code is licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA. 

The code has been designed to use external resources for terms and names and their pronunciation(s): see REAME.md for details. These resources are not directly integrated into the publicly available code on Github, but apart from it. 

The AliGator 1.0. code uses the Wiktionary as an external resource for the terms, names and their pronunciation(s). We've made a few modifications to this resource. The GitHub repository contains the original resource and the modified resource. Both files are licensed under CC-BY-SA. The puns produced by Aligator 1.1. are licensed under CC-BY-SA. 

The AliGator 2.0. code will use the Morphalou lexicon as an external resource for the terms and their pronunciation(s). We've made a few modifications to this resource. The GitHub repository will contain both the original and the modified resource. Both files are licensed under the LGPL for Linguistic Resources (LGPLLR). It will also use the Wiktionary as an external resource for the names and their pronunciation(s). As with Aligator 1.1., we've made a few modifications to this resource. The GitHub repository will contain both the original and the modified resource. Both files are licensed under LGPLLR. The puns produced by Aligator 2.0. are licensed under CC-BY-SA.
