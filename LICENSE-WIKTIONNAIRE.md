# Resources 
The code has been designed to use external resources for terms and names and their pronunciation(s): see README.md for details. These resources are not directly integrated into the publicly available code on Github, but apart from it. 

## Wiktionnaire
The AliGator 1.0. code uses the Wiktionary as an external resource for the terms, names and their pronunciation(s). We've made a few modifications to this resource. The GitHub repository contains the original resource and the modified resource. Both files are licensed under CC-BY-SA. The puns produced by Aligator 1.1. are licensed under CC-BY-SA.
